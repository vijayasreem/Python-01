Here's an example of Python Flask API code that implements the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/credit_check', methods=['POST'])
def credit_check():
    # Get applicant's credit score and financial history from request data
    credit_score = request.json['credit_score']
    financial_history = request.json['financial_history']
    
    # Perform credit check and determine creditworthiness
    creditworthiness = perform_credit_check(credit_score, financial_history)
    
    # Update pre-qualification status in the system
    update_prequalification_status(creditworthiness)
    
    return jsonify({'creditworthiness': creditworthiness})

@app.route('/prequalification', methods=['POST'])
def prequalification():
    # Get applicant's debt-to-income ratio from request data
    debt_to_income_ratio = request.json['debt_to_income_ratio']
    
    # Calculate maximum loan amount and interest rate range
    max_loan_amount = calculate_max_loan_amount(debt_to_income_ratio)
    interest_rate_range = calculate_interest_rate_range(max_loan_amount)
    
    return jsonify({'max_loan_amount': max_loan_amount, 'interest_rate_range': interest_rate_range})

def perform_credit_check(credit_score, financial_history):
    # Perform credit check logic here
    # Return creditworthiness based on credit score and financial history
    return creditworthiness

def update_prequalification_status(creditworthiness):
    # Update pre-qualification status in the system logic here
    pass

def calculate_max_loan_amount(debt_to_income_ratio):
    # Calculate maximum loan amount logic here
    return max_loan_amount

def calculate_interest_rate_range(max_loan_amount):
    # Calculate interest rate range logic here
    return interest_rate_range

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

This code defines two routes `/credit_check` and `/prequalification` which handle the credit check and pre-qualification processes respectively. The credit check route accepts the applicant's credit score and financial history, performs the credit check, updates the pre-qualification status, and returns the creditworthiness. The pre-qualification route accepts the applicant's debt-to-income ratio, calculates the maximum loan amount, and returns the maximum loan amount and interest rate range. The actual logic for credit check, pre-qualification, and updating the pre-qualification status is not implemented and needs to be filled in according to the specific requirements.
