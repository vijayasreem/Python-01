Here's an example of a Python Flask API code that implements the given user story for Vehicle Assessment:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

vehicle_assessments = []

@app.route('/loan_application', methods=['POST'])
def assess_vehicle():
    loan_application = request.get_json()

    if loan_application['vehicle_type'] == 'used':
        # Conduct vehicle assessment
        assessed_value = conduct_vehicle_assessment(loan_application['vehicle_details'])

        if assessed_value < loan_application['loan_amount']:
            return jsonify({'message': 'Loan amount should be adjusted based on the assessed value.'}), 400
        
        loan_application['assessed_value'] = assessed_value
        vehicle_assessments.append(loan_application)
        
        return jsonify({'message': 'Vehicle assessment completed successfully.'}), 200
    
    return jsonify({'message': 'Vehicle assessment is not required for this loan application.'}), 200

def conduct_vehicle_assessment(vehicle_details):
    # Logic to conduct the vehicle assessment by a qualified professional
    # and determine the assessed value and condition of the vehicle
    # Replace this with your own implementation
    
    # For demonstration purposes, let's assume the assessed value is 90% of the vehicle's market value
    market_value = vehicle_details['market_value']
    assessed_value = 0.9 * market_value
    
    return assessed_value

@app.route('/loan_application/<int:application_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_loan_application(application_id):
    # Retrieve loan application by application ID
    for loan_application in vehicle_assessments:
        if loan_application['application_id'] == application_id:
            return jsonify(loan_application), 200
    
    return jsonify({'message': 'Loan application not found.'}), 404

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code sets up a Flask API with two endpoints: `/loan_application` for initiating the vehicle assessment and `/loan_application/<application_id>` for retrieving the assessment results.

When a POST request is made to `/loan_application`, the API checks if the loan application is for a used car. If it is, the API conducts a vehicle assessment by calling the `conduct_vehicle_assessment()` function. The assessed value is then compared with the loan amount requested. If the assessed value is lower, the API returns a response indicating that the loan amount should be adjusted. If the assessed value is higher, the API stores the assessment results in the `vehicle_assessments` list and returns a success response.

When a GET request is made to `/loan_application/<application_id>`, the API retrieves the loan application by the provided application ID and returns the assessment results if found.

Note that this code is a basic example and does not include any authentication or security measures. You should implement appropriate security measures based on your specific requirements.
